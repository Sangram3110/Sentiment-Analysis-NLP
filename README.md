Description :
Sentiment Analysis is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique used to determine the emotional tone behind textual data. It helps organizations analyze customer feedback, product reviews, and social media conversations to understand public sentiment, detect trends, and improve decision-making.

Traditional text analysis methods struggle with large-scale unstructured data, but Machine Learning (ML) and NLP techniques enable automated classification of sentiments into positive, negative, or neutral categories. Businesses leverage sentiment analysis to enhance customer experience, manage brand reputation, and gain competitive insights.

This repository focuses on Sentiment Analysis and Dashboard Creation using NLP, demonstrating data preprocessing, model implementation, sentiment classification, and interactive visualization. We build a dashboard to display sentiment trends, word clouds, and analytics using Python, Power BI, or Streamlit.
